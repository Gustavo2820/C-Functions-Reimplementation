# C Functions Reimplementation

This project aims to create customized versions of some standard C language functions. The objective is to understand how these functions work and learn more about programming in C.
## Work in Progress
For now, only a few string-related functions have been included and tested.
- `my_strlen`: Calculates the length of a string.
- `my_strcpy`: Copies a string to another.
- `my_strcmp`: Compares two strings.
- `my_strcat`: Concatenates two strings.
- `my_memcpy`: Copies memory from one location to another.
## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `src/`: Contains the implementations of the functions.
  - `my_string/`: Implementations related to string operations.
- `headers/`: Contains the header files for the implemented functions.
- `tests/`: Contains test and examples files for the implemented functions.
